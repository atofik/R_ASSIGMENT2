## R Markdown

Your code ran beautifully with no errors, great job!

I can only make very small picky comments, because I do not see issues with your code. 

1. Line 81: You could comment out install.packages("tibble") and leave a comment to install if needed - for some it is unnecessary to download the package if it's already installed. This could then look like:

```{r}

#install.packages("tibble") #Install tibble package if not previously installed
library(tibble)

```
And the same premise can hold for the tidyr package.- super small detail, though!


2. I cannot open "My_visualization.pdf" and get an error that the file is corrupted.However, I can view the .png of the plot.To avoid the error and because the plot can be seen as a png file, it might be ok to delete the pdf file.
